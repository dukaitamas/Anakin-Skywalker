            Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve
            Classic Race Champion
          </p>

          <p class="small-letters">
            In my spare time at Waldâs Parts junk shop I designed and built a
            Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went
            on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by
            a human. Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi
            during the course of my enslavement.

          <p class="small-letters">
            During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in
            charge of large capital construction projects for the Deep Space
            Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY
            by annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core
            Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of the
            imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing
            both projects to run-away photon torpedoes.
